## Overview

JsonStore is a lightweight solution for managing JSON data in Laravel projects. It integrates directly with Laravel's filesystem and configuration systems to offer a hassle-free experience for:

- **Automatic Data Persistence:** Automatically saves changes to disk, avoiding data loss.
- **Lazy Loading:** Loads file data only when needed.
- **Safe Concurrency:** Uses file locking to ensure data integrity during simultaneous accesses.
- **TTL Caching:** Caches values temporarily with automatic expiration.
- **Array Manipulation:** Provides simple helper methods for array operations like insertion and deletion.

## Why Use JsonStore?

- **Simplicity & Readability:** Utilize dot notation to access nested JSON keys, making your code cleaner and easier to read.
- **Performance:** Lazy loading combined with auto-saving reduces unnecessary I/O operations.
- **Data Integrity:** File-level locking prevents race conditions during concurrent writes.
- **Flexibility:** Easily customize storage disks and base paths, making JsonStore adaptable to various project architectures.
- **Versatility:** Perfect for user settings, feature flags, configuration snapshots, and caching responses from APIs.
